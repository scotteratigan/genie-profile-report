# Genie Profile Report

## Generate a CSV of all characters with Genie Profiles

If you have too many characters to keep track of, and can't remember which one is on which account, this can help!

Simply run this in your Genie profile directory and it will create `report.csv` listing all your characters.

See the sample `report.csv` included in the repo.
